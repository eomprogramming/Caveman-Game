The Caveman Game
----------------

If you wish to design a map for this version, download the [Design.jar](https://github.com/downloads/eomprogramming/Caveman-Game/Design.jar) and email the generated code to someone.

Notes to programmers:

* You can't use the normal `PrintStream`, use the `LogCat`
* If your testing it on a device that isn't 480px by 800px you will probably have problems, fix them!
